Weekly Report 3
NOTE: These reports will be for my Kaggle progress only, as I am working with the group on MCMF.
4/28
Progress:
- Started basic EDA
- Looked at correlation between variables and response
- Looked at correlation between variables
- Looked at distribution of about 10 of the variables most correlated with response

Problem:
- Having trouble balancing Kaggle work with MCMF work
- Still figuring out how to deal with the high volume of features

Plan:
- Complete EDA by next week
- Make one submission into Kaggle just to see RMSE baseline
