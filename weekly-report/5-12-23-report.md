#### Progress:
- We met and discussed what we want our final product to look like. So far, we have brainstormed:
  - Shiny App with sliders
  - Bar graphs
  - Maps
  - Category: Program by population
  - Age, program type, geographic cluster, accessibility


#### Problem:
- We were initially stuck with how to incorporate machine learning into the problem, i.e. what we should be predicting using ML models.
- A lot of the variables are categorical in nature, which makes it difficult to use to predict things such as price range or number of programs.
- We focused most of our time on the MCMF data, so we will need to carve out time to work on the Kaggle problem.

#### Plan:
- We plan to talk to Prof. Shi about the direction of our project, whether that is creating a tool that is beneficial for the stakeholders, making a prediction problem that is relevant to the course, or trying to figure out how to strike a balance of both.
- We plan to make a submission for the Kaggle problem this week and continue working on making improved submissions.

After talking to Professor Shi, we have a clearer direction for the project. We will be focusing on the "Shiny" app that will be useful for the stakeholders, where we will be focusing on interactive visualizations.
