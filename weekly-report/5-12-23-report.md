#### Progress:
- We met and discussed what we want our final product to look like. So far, we have brainstormed:
  - Shiny App with sliders
  - Bar graphs
  - Maps
  - Category: Program by population
  - Age, program type, geographic cluster, accessibility


#### Problem:
- We were initially stuck with how to incorporate machine learning into the problem, i.e. what we should be predicting using ML models.
- A lot of the variables are categorical in nature, which makes it difficult to use to predict things such as price range or number of programs.

#### Plan:
- We plan to talk to Prof. Shi about the direction of our project, whether that is creating a tool that is beneficial for the stakeholders, making a prediction problem that is relevant to the course, or trying to figure out how to strike a balance of both.
