### Weekly Report 3
#### 04/28/2023


Progress:
- We reviewed notes from the MCMF presentation to come up with a plan for what we wanted our MCMF project to look like.
- We completed most of the data cleaning and the majority of the EDA and pushed our changes on GitHub.
- Our team created a google slides template in preparation for the MCMF EDA presentation on Friday, May 5th.
- We split up tasks for the presentation.
- For Kaggle, we conducted initial data cleaning on the dataset.


Problem:
- We are still figuring out the best way to incorporate the transportation (bus stops) data. 


Plan:
- We had primarily focused on the MCMF data the past two weeks, so we will be focusing more on the Kaggle dataset this week.
