#### Progress:
- Decided to use Shiny app software over Tableau/PowerBI/etc.
- Performed EDA on our "accessibility variables" (age, capacity, etc.) to get a sense of what visualizations will be most useful to the community partner
- Finalized which visualizations to display on Shiny app
- Achieved lower RMSE on Kaggle after tuning lasso model
- Achieved even lower RMSE on Kaggle after using a Neural Network

#### Problem:
- Limited time to work on both MCMF and Kaggle
- Limited time with other class projects
- Not a ton of experience building a Shiny app (and no experience building one in python)
- Unclear on next direction to take Kaggle models

#### Plan:
- Make visualizations for Shiny app (Cathy & Angelina)
- Make Shiny app architecture (Matt)
- Continue to try different Kaggle models and see what works best (Everyone)
  - Start with something other than PCA
- Meet up several times in the coming week to finalize the projects and make presentations
