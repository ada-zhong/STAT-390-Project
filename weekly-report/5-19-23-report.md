#### Progress:
- Decided to use Shiny app software over Tableau/PowerBI/etc.
- Performed EDA on our "accessibility variables" (age, capacity, etc.) to get a sense of what visualizations will be most useful to the community partner
- Finalized visualizations for Shiny app and split up work (Cathy and Angelina will work on visualizations, Matt will work on Shiny architecture)
- Achieved lower RMSE on Kaggle after tuning lasso model
- Achieved even lower RMSE on Kaggle after using a Neural Network

#### Problem:
- Limited time to work on both MCMF and Kaggle
- Limited time with other class projects
- Not a ton of experience building a Shiny app (and no experience building one in python)
- Unclear on next direction to take Kaggle models

#### Plan:
-
