#### Progress:
- We completed our EDA and our EDA presentation. We split up our slides and met before our presentation to talk through our goals and ideas.
- We incorporated external datasets (bus stops, life expectancy, median income, safety rates, etc) to further our EDA analysis.
- We created maps to compare Chicago population with availability of programs, as places with higher population should have more programs.
- We found out how to calculate the shortest distance from each program to the nearest CTA bus stop. 
- For Kaggle, we completed our EDA and EDA presentation.

#### Problem:
- We still need to figure out how to incorporate machine learning/predictive modeling into our project. In our discussion, we were unsure of what our target response could be.
- We were initially thinking of predicting accessibility via an accessibility index, but realized if we assigned accessibility indices to our current programs that would not require ML to predict in the future. 

#### Plan:
- Meet as a group to determine our final product for the client (whether predictive or a tool) and how to execute our next steps.
