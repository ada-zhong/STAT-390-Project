### Weekly Report 2
#### 04/21/2023

Progress:
Our team met on Wednesday (04/19) to discuss plans for the my_chi data and compare the progress we made on EDA. Our ideas include:
- Checking for uneven accessibility by comparing the locations (latitude and longitude) with population in the region
- Considering other factors such as income, literacy rate, immigration status, transportation, etc
- Visualizing which neighborhoods have seen the greatest rise and improvement in programs since the program's inception in 2020
- Within the 15 focus areas, identify recommendations for each one

On Friday (04/21), we merged the data cleaning and done EDA. 

Problem:
- Doing EDA with so many null values

Plan:
- EDA: category_name, capacity, min_age, max_age, meeting_type, start_date, end_date, program_price, geogrpahic_cluster_name, program_pays_participants, program_has_scholarships, program_provides_transportation, latitude, longitude, program_provides_free_food
  -   capacity, min_age, max_age
  -   start_date, end_date
  -   program_price, program_pays_participants, program_has_scholarships
  -   program_provides_transportation, latitude, longitude
- Cathy: Map comparisons
- Ada: Maybe figure out longitude latitude things
- Matt: look into category name, start/end date

- Far off idea: EDA of description
